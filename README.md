# Fish configuration

My personal [fish](https://fishshell.com) configuration.

Mainly:

- Prompt on two lines
- Custom Git prompt using a [nerdfont](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts)
- Initialise a Node environment (Nodenv) and a Ruby environment (rbenv)
- Set Go environment variables
- Custom aliases


The purpose of this configuration is for my personal usage only. I shared it on Github to version it and it could help some people to set their own fish environment.
